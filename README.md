# SneakySnake: A New Fast and Highly Accurate Pre-Alignment Filter on CPU, GPU, and FPGA for Accelerating Sequence Alignment
The first and the only work that introduces three new efficient pre-alignment filters (*SneakySnake*, *Snake-on-Chip*, and *Snake-on-GPU*) that work efficiently and fast on CPU, GPU, and FPGA architectures and that greatly (by more than two orders of magnitude) expedite sequence alignment. This work is led by Alser et al. (2019).
